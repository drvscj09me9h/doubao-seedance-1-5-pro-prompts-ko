> **from $0.0104 per second** on the APIMart route (billed by resolution tier) — `https://api.apimart.ai/v1` OpenAI 호환 엔드포인트 하나면 되고, 월 구독 플랜은 필요 없습니다. *(2026-10-12 기준)*

**팀들이 APIMart를 통해 Seedance 1.5 Pro(`seedance-1.5-pro`)을 쓰는 이유**

- **키 하나로 카탈로그 전체를.** 동일한 `https://api.apimart.ai/v1` base URL과 `Authorization` 헤더로 Seedance 1.5 Pro(`seedance-1.5-pro`)과 이미지·비디오·언어 모델 300+ 개에 접근할 수 있습니다. 바꾸는 건 `model` 필드뿐이고 클라이언트는 그대로입니다.
- **최소 $1, 종량제.** 구독도, 사전에 규모를 정해야 하는 선불 플랜도 없습니다. $1부터 충전해 호출한 만큼만 쓰면 됩니다.
- **과금 내역은 응답으로 돌아옵니다.** 완료된 모든 작업은 청구 금액(`cost` / `credits_cost`)을 보고하고, `failed`로 표시된 작업은 환불됩니다.
- **비동기 설계.** 제출하고 `task_id`를 받아 `GET /v1/tasks/{id}`를 폴링하면 끝입니다. 배치와 재시도는 별도 통합이 아니라 평범한 큐 작업입니다.

Four **Seedance 1.5 Pro prompts** listed with an example render, the duration, and what the call costs on this route. Copy a recipe, keep the structure, swap the subject.

- Model: `seedance-1.5-pro`
- Recipes: **4** (machine-readable in [`data/prompts.json`](data/prompts.json), table in [`PROMPTS.md`](PROMPTS.md))
- Effective price used below: **$0.0104 per second** — estimated cost of the whole set: **$0.0416**

## What separates a usable recipe from a wasted call

Three rules held up across every render in this set:

1. **Name the material, not the adjective.** "Frosted glass", "matte ceramic", "layered paper" steer rendering far more
   than "beautiful" or "high quality".
2. **Set the light explicitly.** "Single softbox from the left", "golden hour backlight", "focus-stacked studio light"
   remove the guesswork the model would otherwise do for you.
3. **Pin the framing.** Ratio plus lens language (`85mm`, `24mm`, `macro`, overhead flat lay) decides whether the output
   drops into a layout unchanged.

## Prompt structure cheat-sheet

| Slot | What to write | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subject | one concrete object or person, with material | *frosted glass perfume bottle* |
| Light | direction + quality | *single softbox from the left* |
| Framing | ratio + lens or distance | *3:4, medium format look* |
| Setting | surface, backdrop, environment | *wet black stone slab* |
| Finish | render or film character | *commercial product photography* |

## The gallery

Each row is one recipe: example render, category, duration, cost on this route and the exact prompt.

| Output | Recipe | Duration | Cost | Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <img src="assets/01-product-ad-ceramic-mug-thumb.jpg" width="220" alt="Sample video frame generated through APIMart"> | Product ad | 5s | $0.0104 | `Slow 180° orbit around a matte ceramic mug on a dark stone plinth, steam rising, soft key light from camera left, shallow depth of field, product commercial` |

## Run a recipe yourself

```bash
export APIMART_API_KEY=...
python examples/run_recipes.py --dry-run                 # list the recipes, no network
python examples/run_recipes.py --limit 2                 # generate two of them
```

```bash
curl --request POST --url https://api.apimart.ai/v1/videos/generations \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $APIMART_API_KEY" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"seedance-1.5-pro","prompt":"<paste a prompt>","duration":5,"resolution":"720P","size":"16:9"}'
```

Result links expire 72 hours after completion, so store the outputs; the completed task carries `cost` for reconciliation.

## FAQ

**Are these prompts free to reuse?**

Yes — the prompt text in this repository is MIT licensed. The generated images and any third-party marks they contain remain your responsibility, and you should check the model vendor's terms before publishing commercial work.

**Why do the recipes use different aspect ratios?**

Because ratio is a layout decision, not a style one: 1:1 for catalogue and icons, 16:9 for hero and video thumbnails, 3:4 or 2:3 for portraits and print. Pinning it up front avoids cropping later.

**How much does one recipe cost to run?**

**from $0.0104 per second** on the APIMart route (billed by resolution tier). Every completed task reports the exact amount in its `cost` field; a failed task is refunded.

**Can I use a recipe as a template for another subject?**

That is the point. Keep the structure (subject + light + framing + setting + finish) and replace the subject; changing everything at once makes it impossible to tell which phrase moved the output.
